### Goal

**Part 1:** To provide a detail rundown of CTSH's operations, market strategy, industry overview, and competitive positioning using the historical information provided by CTSH, it's competitors, and market analyst.

**Part 2:** Conduct financial analysis to assess CTSH's performance (organic and inorganic) and profitability compared to industry peers. We've utilized important financial metrics, such as EBIT, EBITDA, and ROIC, as well as analyzing capital allocation related to dividends and free cash flow.

**Part 3:** Using our financial analysis, we've constructed a set of assumptions for the foundation of our valuation. Our valuation consisted two methods: **Discounted Cash Flow** and **Trading Comparables**. Based on these valuation metrics, we provided a target price for CTSH.

**Part 4:** We analyze the different investment risk that would prevent CTSH share price from reaching the target price.

**Part 5:** We provide our investment recommendation.
